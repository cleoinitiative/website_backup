Connecting to Wi-Fi

How to Connect Your Device to Wi-Fi
What is Wi-Fi?
Wi-Fi is a wireless signal that allows devices like smartphones, tablets, and computers to connect to the internet or communicate using radio waves, without the need for physical cables.
If Wi-Fi isn’t available, you can use mobile data, but be careful—data usage can cost extra if you go over your plan
Data-saving tips: Use Wi-Fi for activities like streaming videos or downloading large files
Steps to connect
Open the settings app or menu on your device
Find the "Wi-Fi" section and look for available networks
Select your network and enter a password if required
What if there’s no Wi-Fi?
Hands-on: Now, let’s all connect to Wi-Fi together

## Slide 8

Charging and Battery Management

How to Charge Your Device Properly
Identifying the charging port: Most devices have a charging port at the bottom or on the side/back (5)
Plugging in your device: Make sure your charger is fully inserted into the port
Pro Tip: Most devices last several hours on a full charge, but overcharging can degrade battery life over time

## Slide 9

Understanding Web Browsers

What is a Web Browser?
Web browsers are the tools that let you explore the internet
Popular browsers: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge
How to Open a Browser
On most devices, find the browser icon on your home screen or in the app drawer
Click or tap to open
Activity: Open your browser now and look around the home page

## Slide 10

Navigating a Web Browser

Basic Web Browser Navigation
Address bar: This is where you type in website names
Back and forward buttons: Use these to go back to a page you just visited or move forward again
Tabs: Want to keep multiple websites open?
Hands-on: Open a website you’ve visited before and practice navigating between pages using the back and forward buttons

## Slide 11

Navigating Websites

Exploring a Typical Website Layout 
Example: Wikipedia
Menus and navigation bars: These are usually at the top of the page and help you move around the site
Clickable links: Links take you to other pages or sections—usually underlined or highlighted
Scrolling: Scroll down the page to see more content
Going Back to Previous Pages
Use the back arrow on your browser to return to a previous page
Tip: If you get lost on a website, you can always go back to the home page by clicking the site’s logo or home button

## Slide 12

Understanding Internet Safety

Recognizing Safe Websites
Look for HTTPS or a padlock icon in the web address to ensure a site is secure, especially for online purchases or banking
Avoiding Suspicious Links and Pop-Ups
Don’t click on pop-ups or emails from people you don’t know
If something looks too good to be true, it probably is
Password Basics
Use a strong password: mix letters, numbers, and symbols
Avoid using easy-to-guess passwords like “123456” or “password.”

## Slide 13

Troubleshooting Common Issues

Wi-Fi Issues
If your device won’t connect to Wi-Fi, try turning the Wi-Fi off and on again
Restart your device if the connection isn’t working
App or Browser Freezing - On a smartphone or tablet, swipe up to close the app, clear it, then open it again
Low Battery Warning
If you see a low battery warning, plug in your charger as soon as possible
If your device shuts off, don’t worry—it will restart when charged
