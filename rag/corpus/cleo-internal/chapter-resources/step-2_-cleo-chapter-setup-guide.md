Part 1c: Choosing Leadership

For your initial executive committee, choose people who you feel will best help you bring your chapter to reality. These can be anyone, even friends, but make sure they are motivated and dedicated to the project.

After choosing your co-presidents add them to both the main CLEO Chapter Leaders group chat in GroupME and the separate group chat with just your chapter leaders and the CLEO founders.

For all other execs, add them to only the separate group chat.

Make sure you have a personal group chat or communication channel between all of your execs and your chapter faculty advisor.

Part 2: Find a Retirement Home and Reach Out

Before you recruit volunteers, it is important that you find a retirement home in your area. Send an email to some retirement homes/senior living communities in your area (template in a couple slides) and wait for a response. Try to target larger communities with more independent senior communities. For example, “Independent Living” and “Assisted Living” are often your best bets, but a Nursing Home is more likely to have less people physically able to still use a phone. No matter what, make sure to include a conversation in your initial communications checking what proportion of the facility’s population would benefit from CLEO.
If they don’t respond to your email within a couple days you can send a follow-up. If still no response, walk into the home and ask to speak to the activities director. This is what we had to do! DON'T EXPECT EMPLOYEES OF SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES TO DO THINGS FOR YOU, you will be the most successful if you know exactly what you want from them. If you are struggling, message the founders, we are always happy to help.
If they are willing to work with you, set up an in person meeting to talk more about CLEO, find a suitable long-term schedule, and answer any questions they may have. We recommend volunteering weekly (ex. every Wednesday at 3:00PM), and we stay for as long as necessary to help all the seniors that need assistance (it almost never goes over 45 minutes to 1 hour, but if it does just give people more community service hours). 
Very important: Have a discussion with the activities person/your contact in the senior living home about how to make sure all the seniors of the residence are aware of your service. The last thing we want is for you to go through all this work to start a volunteering club and nobody even knows that you guys are there to help them. Often, there is an internal newsletter at the home or something similar, but if not we have posters in our setup resources folder you can send to them to print and post around the retirement home.

Part 3: Recruit Volunteers and Establish the CLEO Club

Once you feel you have secured a senior living facility, it’s now time to set CLEO up with your school. Every school is different, so make sure you meet all requirements for creating a club.
You are welcome to present our Instagram, website, or any of our news segments to show club members and gain people's interest. We have also accumulated lots of presentations from other chapters (last slide).
You don’t need a lot of people to start off; 3-5 consistent members is enough! As CLEO gains popularity, more people will come to you to sign up. 
The bottom line is if you told the retirement home you would be there at a certain time, you must be there. No-showing without ideally 24 hours notice is very disrespectful to the seniors’ time and hurts your relationship with them.
