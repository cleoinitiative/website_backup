Dear [name of retirement home],

I am writing to you on behalf of the Computer Literacy Education Outreach Club (CLEO) at [school name] to inquire about the possibility of doing community service at your retirement home on a weekly basis. The CLEO Initiative is dedicated to helping seniors with their technology needs. We believe that we can make a positive impact on the lives of the residents at your facility, just as other CLEO Chapters already have in many other retirement homes around the country.

We propose that our club members visit your retirement home on a regular basis to provide assistance with technology-related tasks such as troubleshooting everyday problems, navigating the internet, and using smartphone apps, just to name a few. We believe that these services will help to keep the residents connected with the outside world and facilitate their ability to stay engaged with their loved ones, as well as help with countless other issues.

We would be honored to be able to contribute to the well-being of the residents at your retirement home and we hope that you will consider our proposal. If you are interested, we would be happy to schedule a meeting, either in-person or virtually to discuss further.

Thank you for considering our request. We look forward to hearing from you! If interested, the links to more information about CLEO are down below.
