### Preparation Tips

Before the Session:

Review the Volunteer Schedule (if you are using one) and ensure volunteers are planning to attend

Materials Checklist:

Sign-in sheet for seniors and volunteers.

Setup and Volunteer Check-In (5-10 minutes before start time)

Volunteers arrive early to set up the space and prepare for the session.

Ensure all necessary materials are ready:

Power strips, chargers, or device stands.

Working internet connection and password known

Welcome and Introduction (5-10 minutes)

Greet seniors and volunteers as they arrive.

Encourage seniors to share what they’d like help with during the session (e.g., email, social media, device troubleshooting).

One-on-One or Small Group Support (45-60 minutes)

Match seniors with volunteers based on their tech support needs.

Tip for Volunteers: Be patient and explain steps clearly; use examples when possible.

If a senior is waiting, try to streamline the process with the seniors already being helped

Volunteers should focus on teaching rather than doing tasks for seniors. Ideally, the seniors should do all the steps themselves, and the volunteers should check to see that they remember what they learned.

Wrap-Up and Feedback (5-10 minutes)

Ask seniors for feedback:

What was helpful?

What do they want to learn next time?

Encourage participants to practice what they learned at home.

Share details of the next meeting or event, and encourage them to come.
