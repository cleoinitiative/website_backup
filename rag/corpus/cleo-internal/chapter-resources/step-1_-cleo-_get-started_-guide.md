## Slide 1

CLEO “Get Started” Guide

Lead with us, for others

## Slide 2

Pep Talk

We want to assist our community by fighting computer illiteracy in older generations. In other words, we want to help peoples’ grandparents with technology!
In addition to helping with technology, CLEO gives seniors someone to talk to and connect with. You will learn just as much from the seniors as they do from you.
CLEO not only provides support for the seniors, but it serves as a productive and helpful way for students to learn and gain community service hours.
As a chapter leader, CLEO will provide you with a priceless leadership opportunity, allowing you to learn, serve, organize, communicate, and guide.
We don’t want to stop here! There are seniors across the country who need help, and we want to keep expanding. You have the opportunity to be a part of our future. Join us and reach out to friends/family that you know who might be interested. Trust us, we have big plans!

## Slide 3

How it will work

We are about communication and community. As a chapter leader you will be obligated to keeping us and other chapter leaders updated while working to start and run your chapter of CLEO.
Once you finish this presentation, you will add yourself to the CLEO Chapter Leader GroupMe (link on final slide). You will then follow the instructions in the pinned message. In the future, you will also be expected to periodically keep us updated with your progress. 
Chapter leaders who display hard work, determination, loyalty, and effort to expand will earn more responsibility in the project. For example, leadership over multiple chapters within your area. Remember, we are a newer nonprofit and we need people to help us grow, any and all help towards that end will not go unnoticed. We want to work with motivated individuals with similar visions!

## Slide 4

How we got Started + Recommendations

After we had the idea of CLEO, we reached out to our local retirement home in Fort Myers, Brookdale Senior Living, to share our idea. However, Brookdale did not respond to any of our emails. After school one day we walked into Brookdale and asked to meet with the activities director. She was a huge factor in helping us get started. 
Our club was small at first, but after a few months we became more popular and gained members. We even expanded to two retirement homes in our area.
We learned that we couldn’t rely on others to fulfill our dreams for us, and this you will have to keep in mind. Don’t be discouraged if you run into a roadblock. The seniors in your town need you to persevere because without CLEO they are unlikely to get this essential help. Find a way to persist and make it happen!
Keep in mind that the following steps are all recommendations on how to get started; as long as you structure and lead your chapter in accordance to our bylaws, there are no problems. We are learning with you.

## Slide 5

How YOU should start, Step 0: Join the GroupME

It’s extremely important to CLEO that when you think of forming a chapter you join our CLEO Chapter Leader GroupMe (this is how we can guide you through the process of starting your chapter and monitor your progress).
You must also create a separate GroupMe group chat with Christian Laquis, Aaron Smolyar, and Derrick Hueniken after joining the Chapter Leader GroupMe. You can find them by looking at the Admins of the Chapter Leaders Group. This is where we will communicate on chapter-specific issues and updates so it doesn’t clog the main group. 
Once you create this separate link, return to the main group and FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE PINNED MESSAGE. Those instructions will lead you through the rest of the chapter setup process.
