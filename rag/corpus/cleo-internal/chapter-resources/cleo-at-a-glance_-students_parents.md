# CLEO at a Glance: Empowering Students, Connecting Generations

## Welcome to CLEO!

At Computer Literacy Education Outreach (CLEO), we believe in the power of students to make a difference. CLEO is a nonprofit organization where high school students volunteer to help seniors develop digital literacy skills, bridging the generational divide. By fostering intergenerational connections, CLEO allows students to make a real impact while gaining valuable experience.

Whether you’re a student eager to make a difference or a parent looking for meaningful extracurricular opportunities for your child, CLEO is the perfect place to combine community service, leadership development, and lifelong learning.

## What Does CLEO Do?

CLEO’s Mission:
Our mission is to bridge the technology gap between generations by empowering high school students to teach senior citizens how to use technology. We aim to:

Empower Seniors: Seniors are taught essential digital skills, allowing them to stay connected with family, friends, and the world.

Equip Students: Students gain leadership experience, community service hours, and a deeper understanding of how to communicate and teach effectively.

Foster Connection: We build meaningful relationships across generations, helping seniors feel less isolated and students develop empathy and communication skills.

## Why Should Students Join CLEO?

1. Make a Difference in Your Community

Students directly help seniors overcome challenges related to technology, from sending emails to setting up video calls with family. You’ll be making a meaningful impact in their lives!

2. Gain Valuable Experience and Skills

CLEO gives students the opportunity to develop leadership and teaching skills, all while performing valuable community service. You’ll learn how to communicate complex ideas in simple terms, be patient, and solve problems—all skills that are invaluable in school, work, and life.

3. Build Your Resume

Colleges and employers look for students who demonstrate initiative and community engagement. CLEO provides an excellent opportunity to showcase leadership, volunteerism, and dedication to helping others.

4. Earn Community Service Hours

CLEO is a great way to accumulate community service hours required for graduation or scholarships. Every volunteer session contributes toward your service goals.

## What Will Students Do at CLEO?

When you join CLEO, you will:

Help Seniors with Technology: Assist seniors with learning how to use smartphones, computers, tablets, and the internet. This includes tasks like setting up email, making video calls, navigating social media, and staying safe online.

Teach Essential Digital Skills: From using apps to teaching online safety, you’ll be guiding seniors step-by-step through the process.

Build Relationships: Volunteering isn’t just about tech support— it’s about connecting with seniors and hearing their stories. You’ll build relationships that extend beyond technology.

## A Parent’s Perspective: Why CLEO is Beneficial for Your Child

1. Develop Leadership and Responsibility

CLEO offers a unique platform for students to lead and organize. Your child will gain experience working with peers, leading volunteer sessions, and taking initiative—skills that will benefit them in high school, college, and beyond.

2. Build Communication and Empathy

At CLEO, students develop strong communication skills by teaching seniors who may not be familiar with modern technology. The patience and empathy required to work with different age groups help students grow emotionally and socially.

3. Safe and Structured Volunteer Opportunity

CLEO provides a safe and structured environment for your child to volunteer. Our chapters operate in schools, and all interactions are supervised by chapter leaders and faculty advisors.

4. College and Career Readiness

Participating in CLEO not only helps students fulfill community service requirements, but also strengthens their college applications and resumes. CLEO’s focus on leadership, communication, and service provides key experiences that set students apart.

## How CLEO Works

1. Weekly Volunteering Sessions

Students will attend weekly sessions where they work with seniors at local senior living facilities or community centers. Each session focuses on different aspects of technology, from basic smartphone skills to internet safety and social media.

2. Leadership Opportunities

CLEO chapters are student-led, and there are multiple leadership roles available:

Chapter President: Oversees chapter operations.

Secretary: Manages communication and schedules.

Treasurer: Manages chapter funds and organizes fundraising activities.

3. Training and Support

Every student volunteer is provided with the necessary training to work with seniors. Students will learn how to teach basic technology skills in a way that’s approachable and fun for seniors. Faculty advisors and CLEO leadership are there to guide students every step of the way.
