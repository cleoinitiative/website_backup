## CLEO at a Glance for Seniors

### What is CLEO?

Welcome to Computer Literacy Education Outreach (CLEO)!
CLEO is a program where high school student volunteers help seniors like you learn how to use technology. We’re here to assist you in becoming more confident with your devices—whether it’s a smartphone, tablet, or computer—so you can stay connected with family and friends, explore the internet, and enjoy digital tools like email, video calls, and social media.

At CLEO, our goal is to help you:

Understand your devices: Learn how to use your smartphone, tablet, or computer.

Stay connected: Use tools like email, text messaging, and video calls to stay in touch with loved ones.

Explore new skills: Enjoy entertainment apps, shop online safely, and use social media.

Stay safe online: Learn how to protect your personal information and avoid scams.

### What You Should Ask CLEO Volunteers

Our volunteers are here to help you with a variety of tech-related tasks! Here are examples of things you can ask for help with:

Device Basics:

How to turn your device on/off.

How to adjust settings like volume or screen brightness.

How to connect to Wi-Fi.

Communication Tools:

Sending and receiving text messages.

Making phone calls.

Using video calls like FaceTime or Zoom to connect with family.

Much, Much More

### What You Should NOT Ask CLEO Volunteers

While our volunteers are happy to assist you with most tech-related needs, there are some things they cannot help with for safety and privacy reasons:

Sensitive or Financial Information:

Volunteers cannot help you manage bank accounts, pay bills online, or handle any financial transactions.

Volunteers cannot input or manage sensitive information like Social Security numbers or passwords to important accounts.

Medical Information:

Volunteers are not able to help with accessing or managing medical records online or through apps.

Advanced IT Support:

Volunteers cannot fix hardware issues, repair broken devices, or install complex software programs.

If you need help with any of the above, we recommend seeking assistance from an employee of your living facility or a professional service provider.
