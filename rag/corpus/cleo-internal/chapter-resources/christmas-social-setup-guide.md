Choose a warm and festive holiday color scheme: red, green, gold, and white.

Incorporate CLEO branding subtly (e.g., blue and white CLEO logo ornaments or banners).

Decorating the Venue:

Entrance:

Use a Christmas wreath or garland on the door to welcome attendees.

Set up a small table for name tags with fairy lights or holiday-themed décor.

Seating Area:

Add festive tablecloths or placemats.

Place small holiday centerpieces (e.g., candles, pinecones, or mini Christmas trees).

Scatter snowflake cutouts or holiday confetti on tables.

Photo Corner:

Create a photo booth area with a festive backdrop, props like Santa hats or reindeer antlers, and a CLEO-branded holiday banner.

Lighting and Music:

Use string lights around the room for a cozy ambiance.

Play soft instrumental Christmas music or classic holiday songs in the background.

### Refreshment and Snack Ideas Guide

Drinks:

Hot chocolate bar with toppings (e.g., marshmallows, whipped cream, peppermint sticks).

Coffee, tea, or apple cider for variety.

Water infused with seasonal fruits (e.g., oranges, cranberries).

Snacks:

Assorted holiday cookies (sugar cookies, gingerbread).

Mini sandwiches or sliders (e.g., turkey and cranberry).

Cheese and cracker platters with seasonal fruits like grapes or figs.

Festive trail mix with pretzels, red-and-green candies, and nuts.

Prepare a mix of Christmas-themed and tech-related questions (e.g., “Which company created the first mobile phone?”).

Divide participants into teams and award small prizes to the winners.

Holiday Bingo:

Create bingo cards with Christmas-related icons (e.g., Santa, reindeer, snowman) or tech icons (e.g., email, smartphone).

Use candies or buttons as markers.

Cookie Decorating:

Provide plain sugar cookies, frosting, sprinkles, and edible decorations.
