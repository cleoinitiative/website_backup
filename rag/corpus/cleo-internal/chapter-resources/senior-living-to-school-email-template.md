Subject: Connecting your students with a meaningful leadership opportunity

Dear [Contact at School],

I am reaching out to explore a mutual opportunity that recently surfaced. I am excited to invite your students to join us in starting a chapter of the CLEO Initiative, a nationally recognized nonprofit empowering high school students to teach seniors essential technology skills. CLEO bridges the digital divide while fostering meaningful intergenerational relationships, offering students a unique opportunity to develop leadership skills and make a tangible impact in both their school and overall community.

[Community Name] is partnering with CLEO to expand this inspiring program to our senior living community. We are hoping you could help us find motivated students to lead the way as CLEO chapter leaders. CLEO provides all the tools and resources necessary to ensure students succeed, including a comprehensive setup guide, mentorship, ready-made lesson plans, and an empowering community of chapter leaders nationwide.

You can learn more about CLEO at their website, cleoinitiative.org. If you believe there’s potential for a CLEO chapter at your school, I’d love to explore this further with you. The next step would be a Zoom meeting with the CLEO team, where they can walk us through the program details and answer any questions. I’ve CC’d their team on this email for ease of coordination.

Thank you for considering this opportunity to empower your students and enrich our senior communities. Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions or to arrange the next steps.

Best,
