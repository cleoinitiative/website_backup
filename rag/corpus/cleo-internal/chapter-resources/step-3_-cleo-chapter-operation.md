Part 1: Communication

## Slide 3

Part 1: Communication

To best manage your chapter, we recommend that you create a group chat with all members of your chapter along with your faculty advisor. Here, you will send reminders before every meeting, give updates if necessary, and do any other chapter-wide communication needed. GroupMe is a great platform, but text and other options work too. You should also create a group chat with just the chapter leaders and the faculty advisor to discuss things related to running the club, attendance, etc. which don’t need to be broadcasted to all members. 

Make sure your members stay active, and cut those who do not, especially if you feel that there are too many people in the club who aren’t volunteering. Try to set specific goals for all volunteers to hit to stay active: e.g. all volunteers must come to at least one session per month, all volunteers must do at least 5 volunteer hours per semester, etc.

Part 2: The Nitty-Gritty

## Slide 5

Part 2a: Forms beginning Fall 25’, skip for now

This is an incredibly important step, and thankfully it is pretty easy to do. You (specifically the treasurer actually) and your faculty advisor are responsible for helping us collect the following forms.
A contract between you and us (your chapter and CLEO the organization)
A contract between you and your school
A contract between you and your volunteering location

And the following from each student:
A release of liability form
A signed volunteer handbook
To complete this step, message us in our private group chat, and we will give you the next steps.

## Slide 6

2b: Volunteer Onboarding

Before you take anyone to the senior residence, you must onboard them. We have a nifty Volunteer Training powerpoint. This contains VERY IMPORTANT RULES about our expectations for you and your volunteers.Every volunteer must see these slides before volunteering. This includes people joining the chapter later in the year.

Please find a time to present this information to all volunteers before moving on. Make sure that all forms are submitted by the time you show this slideshow. For students joining late, feel free to just share it with them digitally and instruct them to look it over.

Part 3: The good stuff

(actually doing the volunteering)

## Slide 8

Part 3a: Meet and Greet

Before you and your volunteers begin to volunteer for the year, schedule a meet-and-greet for your first scheduled volunteer meeting with all your volunteers and as many seniors as you can get to come.

More information about how to structure this can be found here: [LINK]

For this and other social-type events, feel free to collect money from students/through a donation drive/ etc. if you would like to purchase any extras like snacks, decorations, etc.

## Slide 9

Part 3b: Regular Tech Support

Once you have your volunteers and have set up days with the retirement home, it is time to start volunteering. Once again, try to be consistent in your scheduling and location so seniors can start to get in the groove of your volunteering timing.

Attendance might be slow at first, but do what you can and eventually more seniors will hear about CLEO and show up. Remember, it’s important that at least one exec from the club shows up for every scheduled session, or you need to at least let the retirement home know about nobody being able to show up beforehand. We don’t want to leave the seniors in the dust waiting for nothing (very rude and for us the worst case scenario). 

The problems that the seniors will have are mostly simple. If you don’t know how to solve something, though, try looking it up on your phone. There are some things that we simply cannot solve. If you and in that case you can kindly tell the senior that they need professional help. 
You will end up having a lot more fun than you think you will!

More info on how this should be structured can be found here: [LINK]

## Slide 10

Part 3c: Volunteering Rules

When volunteering, it is essential that you and your volunteers follow these guidelines. This is something that every volunteer agrees to in the forms they submit before beginning volunteering, and it is also in the volunteer handbook.
Stay away from the following:
Banking information/online banking account details
Medical information/giving medical advice
Legal information/giving legal advice
Permanently deleting anything from a device
Doing anything beyond your knowledge to a device
It is always ok to tell a senior that you aren’t allowed to help them with something and to refer them to the staff at their senior living facility. Those employees were the ones who had to help them before you got there, and they are happy to do it again. If a problem is too difficult for you and others around you to diagnose, you can tell the senior to ask the staff at the retirement home if they should seek professional IT help.
As a member of CLEO, you are being trusted to be around some of society’s most vulnerable people in order to improve their quality of life. For that reason, ANY CLEO member who is found taking personal belongings or information from a senior citizen and using them in any way not approved by that senior will be immediately removed from CLEO rosters, reported to their school’s disciplinary staff, and will potentially be reported to law enforcement as well.

## Slide 11

Part 3d (optional but strongly encouraged): Eventually Hold Classes

You may choose to hold a class for a large portion of the retirement home at once. 
We have premade curricula for both monthly and quarterly presentations. It can be found here: [LINK]
If that folder looks a little empty, it is because we are in the process of getting slideshows made. Check back soon!

## Slide 12

Part 3e (also optional but also recommended): Socials

We have planned the skeleton of two types of social outside the meet-and-greet that we encourage you to hold each year. Work with your community to rally resources to get these implemented. Click the links below to learn more. Make sure to plan ahead, and begin work to get these implemented at least a month before you plan to hold it. These have proven to be a great way to bring your community together in a major way!

1. Holiday Social (before winter break)
2. Senior Graduation Ceremony (before summer break)

## Slide 13

SAMPLE SCHEDULES

Here are some sample schedules for an idea of what your year of volunteering could look like. It includes one for monthly powerpoints and one for quarterly.

Schedules can be found here: [LINK]

## Slide 14

Part 3f: Reporting

As a chapter of CLEO, you are required to periodically fill out a report to let us know how you are doing. More information on this soon.

## Slide 15

Part 4: What’s next

You are in a good rhythm with volunteering, what should you think about now?

## Slide 16

Part 4a: Leadership Transition

As you get older, you will one day leave your school. It is important that you take steps to ensure that CLEO can continue at your school after you are gone.We know that many people starting the club for the first time at their school are underclassman, but if you are a senior or junior, the leadership structure should look something like this (includes only essential positions):

## Slide 17

Part 4a, Continued

The idea is that, by the time you are a senior, every year your chapter starts with a class of leadership which are Juniors and a class of leadership which are Seniors working together to run the club. By the time you reach second semester every year, you should be ready to bring a new class of leaders (Sophomores) into the club to learn from and work with you. This ensures that there is always enough people to comfortably run the chapter and delegate labor between them, while also being ready for the Seniors to graduate and leave every year.

## Slide 18

Part 1b: Social Media (Optional)

We recommend that you create an instagram account specific to your chapter. This will allow you to publicize yourself and your volunteering. 

Tips:
Name your account: “cleo.school name”
Follow our main instagram account @cleoinitiative and let us know in the GroupMe so we can follow you back. You can also follow the other individual chapter accounts.
When you post, notify us and add our main instagram account as a collaborator. This way your account will reach more people.

## Slide 19

Part 4b: Network and Expand

A big goal for CLEO is to expand and help more seniors.
Reach out to anyone that you know who may be interested, and we will help them get started. Forward them to our getting started page on our website cleoinitiative.org/#/get-started
We will be sure to keep track of who helps us out in expanding and consider them more highly when we begin to create region-level positions in CLEO

## Slide 20

Part 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 1

Repeat

## Slide 21

Repeat!

Use this slideshow as a guide for each new school year. Per-volunteer forms must be re-submitted every year, and each volunteer should be re-onboarded through the training slideshow every year as well. Generally, each year will look similar whether it is you first or your tenth volunteering for CLEO.

## Slide 22

Resources

Below is a link to our resources folder, shared between all of our CLEO Chapters. We ask that you use these resources, but also add any additional resources (presentations, brochures, flyers, images, etc.) as you go along.
