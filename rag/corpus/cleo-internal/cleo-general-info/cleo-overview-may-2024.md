What is CLEO?

CLEO, which stands for Computer Literacy Education Outreach, is a Nonprofit Organization aimed at bridging the digital divide between generations by empowering senior citizens with the skills and knowledge necessary to navigate the digital world. At its core, CLEO is a student-led organization that provides a platform for high school and college students to volunteer and give back to their community by teaching computer literacy skills to seniors in local retirement homes. By fostering meaningful intergenerational connections and promoting lifelong learning, CLEO strives to empower seniors to stay connected with loved ones, engage in online activities, and gain a sense of independence and self-confidence in today’s increasingly technology-dominated society.

Our Story

The idea of CLEO was sparked during a conversation between two friends in 2021 as sophomores in high school. They were speaking about their own grandparents who lived out of the country. Unfortunately, due to lack of skills with technology, one of them wasn’t able to communicate regularly or have a close relationship with their grandparents before they passed, especially after COVID-19. The friends discovered that they each had similar experiences with their individual grandparents, and, at that moment, they realized this problem was not just a stereotype. Senior citizens across the world cannot keep up with today’s rapidly advancing technology. The time had passed for their grandparents, but they knew that they could make a difference for others in the area. So, because they didn’t have cars at the time, they walked over to the local retirement home, Brookdale Senior Living, to propose their idea for their club named CLEO, which stands for Computer Literacy Education Outreach, and the assisted living home loved it. A few weeks later, the CLEO Volunteers walked into their first technology-helping session at Brookdale expecting to merely assist seniors with their phones and computers, but they left having accomplished so much more. They restored the seniors’ ability to contact loved ones who hadn’t visited in months, or even years. In addition, they provided someone for the seniors to talk to, fostering meaningful intergenerational connections and creating communities that will last a lifetime. During the following weeks, CLEO rapidly became popular in their school, community, and even nation. CLEO was featured on multiple news programs including NBC 2, CBS National Evening News with Norah O'Donnell, and the National Honor Society. The profound impact that CLEO had made it clear that reaching just one retirement home wasn’t enough, and CLEO has been expanding ever since.

Our Impact

- Technological Illiteracy will be a recurring issue for generations to come; tech is advancing rapidly and show no signs of diminishing, especially with the recent introduction of AI into society.
- We hope that by enabling seniors to improve their technological literacy, we help them live more fulfilling and independent lives and deliver to them numerous invaluable benefits. 
- In addition to the expected benefits for the seniors, our project also provided numerous benefits for the students involved. By participating in our project, students had the opportunity to develop a range of skills and experiences that will benefit them personally and professionally. They also had the chance to make a meaningful difference in the lives of seniors in their community.
