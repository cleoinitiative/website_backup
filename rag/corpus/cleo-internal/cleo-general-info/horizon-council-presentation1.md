Our Story

After struggling to connect with our grandparents who live out of the country, we decided to make a difference for others.
As sophomores in high school, we walked across the road to the Brookdale Senior Living retirement home to propose our idea of CLEO.
We walked into our first CLEO session intending to assist seniors with technology, but we left having had benefitting both their and our lives immensely. 
CLEO rapidly gained attention and, we were recognized on multiple new sources including CBS National Evening News with Norah O'Donnell.
We’ve been expanding ever since.

Our Impact

## Slide 5

Our Future

CLEO currently has over 15 chapters (and multiple pending) in Florida, New York, Kentucky, North Carolina, Philadelphia, Ohio, Illinois, Canada, and more; people believe in our initiative, and we hope you do as well.
Our goal is to be have multiple CLEO Chapters in every state and beyond by 2030.

Fields of Development

We lack the legal structure and capital to incentivise students to follow our organization and chapter plan.
We’re asking for connections to schools and legal/professional guidance to help us expand bring CLEO to the next level, ensuring that no senior is left behind in today’s rapidly advancing world.
