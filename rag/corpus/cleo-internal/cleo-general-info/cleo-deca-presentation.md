EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The CLEO Initiative began in response to the growing problem of a lack of computer literacy among 
seniors. We noticed that many seniors in our lives were struggling to keep up with the ever-evolving 
world of technology, and we wanted to provide older individuals like them with the support and 
resources they need to bridge the gap. We did this by offering tech support sessions and classes at the 
Brookdale retirement home near our school with the goal of helping seniors become more confident 
and independent when it comes to using their devices. Our mission is to empower seniors to stay 
connected with loved ones, stay informed, and continue to learn and grow, even as they age.
The Computer Literacy Educational Outreach (CLEO) Initiative is a nine-month-long 
community service project aimed at improving the technological literacy of senior 
citizens at the Brookdale Retirement Home in Fort Myers, FL.

Send out a Tech Survey to the Residents:
The surveys helped us gather more information on 
the seniors’ technological needs and preferences. They 
also ensured that our members were familiar with 
the devices the residents use most often (survey in 
appendix).
Host a Club/Senior Meet and Greet:
This get-together made us more familiar with the 
seniors we would soon be serving. In addition, the 
meet-and-greet served as an opportunity to build 
a sense of community between our volunteers and 
the seniors.
Establish a Consistent Weekly Schedule:
A constant and reliable source of support for seniors 
was crucial for succeeding in this project. Following 
a predictable schedule allowed seniors to anticipate 
our visits and helped us build trust and establish 
strong relationships with them over time.
Prepare Monthly Classes on Specific Topics:
Finally, we wanted to provide structured and 
focused learning opportunities for seniors. The 
classes ensured that seniors had the opportunity to 
learn new skills and gain a deeper understanding of 
technology in a structured and efficient manner.

ACHIEVEMENTS
“ Very often, I brought CLEO up while talking 
to potential residents. I tell them how 
carefully you show them the real problem 
and how to fix it. That is something that 
their grandkids usually don’t take the time 
to do. Grandkids just grab the device, fix 
the problem and hand it right back; it isn’t 
a long-term solution. Honestly, CLEO was a 
main selling point for many new Brookdale 
residents.
Susan Scott
Brookdale Director of Sales
“ The ability to help provide much-needed 
assistance to the elderly population at 
Brookdale was truly remarkable and is 
something I’m very thankful to have been 
a part of. CLEO has not only helped those 
in need of it most, but it has also allowed 
for a special bond to form between two 
vastly different age groups with entirely 
different life experiences. A huge amount of 
fulfillment comes from being able to make 
such a positive impact on the lives of others; 
your presence is the “highlight” of their 
week. Looking forward, I would be eager 
to continue working on this project if more 
opportunities arose from the Computer 
Literacy Education Outreach Club.

The main problem addressed by our project was the lack of technological literacy 
among seniors. The rapid development and adoption of novel electronics and 
software for communication have created an ever-growing tech experience gap 
between the generations. Many seniors struggle with technology daily, which can 
lead to frustration and stress when using personal devices, communicating with 
loved ones, or accessing online services. This problem is not new, but it has been 
exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Travel restrictions and social distancing 
visitor limitations made it such that many senior citizens had to rely on technology 
for communication and access to essential services during lockdown. In addition 
to the practical challenges and risks seniors face, the constantly evolving nature 
of technology means that this problem is likely to continue and even worsen in 
the future.
A lack of computer skills can also lead to social isolation for seniors, making it 
more difficult to maintain relationships. This was especially true during the height 
of the pandemic when in-person visits to retirement homes were limited or 
restricted altogether.
Additionally, seniors face a lack of social interaction with younger generations, 
which can also lead to loneliness. According to the CDC, “[s]ocial isolation 
significantly increase[s] a person’s risk of premature death from all causes, a risk 
that may rival those of smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity”(“Loneliness”).
Seniors’ lack of technological literacy also puts them at risk of scams and other 
online dangers. According to data from the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), 
a division of the FBI, seniors are particularly vulnerable to tech support scams, 
with around 92,000 elderly victims losing $1.7 billion to scams in 2021(FBI). These 
scams often take advantage of the fact that many seniors are unfamiliar with 
technology and trick them into paying for something that a more experienced 
user of technology would quickly dismiss as fraudulent.

Through our project, we aimed to give seniors the knowledge and confidence they needed to use their devices, access services 
online, and reduce their risk of falling victim to scams and other online dangers. We hope that by enabling seniors to improve their 
technological literacy, we have helped them live more fulfilling and independent lives and have mitigated their sense of anxiety 
around technology.
In addition to the expected benefits for the seniors, our project also provided numerous benefits for the students involved. 
By participating in our project, students had the opportunity to develop a range of skills and experiences that will benefit 
them personally and professionally. They also had the chance to make a meaningful difference in the lives of seniors in their 
community.

B. PROJECT SCOPE AND EXPECTED BENEFITS
SCOPE
Our project involved creating a club at our school that visited one retirement home every week for nine months to provide tech 
support to the residents and to periodically hold classes on ranging technological topics. These classes covered topics like how to 
use iPads and how to identify and avoid scams on the web. The project aimed to help seniors overcome the challenges and risks 
associated with their lack of technological literacy. By coming consistently, we not only taught them how to fix their day-to-day 
technology-related problems but also helped them build up a sense of familiarity with their devices.
BENEFITS TO SENIORS

## Page 8

Increase Computer Literacy: We provided tech support sessions and tailored classes for seniors, helping them become more familiar 
and comfortable with technology. This, in turn, made them more independent by increasing their ability to communicate with 
loved ones, access essential services, use online tools such as online banking and email, and use hardware such as printers, desktop 
computers, laptops, and phones. Open invitation tech support sessions were held weekly at a set time and place to let the residents 
know when and where to expect us. Additionally, classes addressing a specific tech topic were held once a month. The subjects of 
these classes were selected based on recommendations from residents and the retirement home staff.
Promote Social Interaction: We allowed seniors to engage with younger people through our tech support sessions and 
classes. In addition to providing a sense of community and intergenerational connection, this also helped seniors feel less 
isolated.
Prevent Internet Scams: We dedicated one of our monthly classes to educating seniors on how to spot and avoid scams 
and provided them with the tools and knowledge to navigate the online world safely. By helping seniors improve their 
technological literacy and become more confident with the internet, we believe we reduced their risk of falling victim to 
scams and other online dangers.

F. PROPOSED BUDGET
We found it unnecessary to allocate a budget for the project as we provided a volunteer service to the seniors of Brookdale. 
Additionally, our focus was on educating seniors about their own devices, so there was no need to purchase additional devices.

These five metrics were the ones we believed would be the best indicators of the initiative’s success. Along with these metrics, we 
collected a few additional ones, such as the percent attendance of all Brookdale residents, percent satisfaction with the service, etc. 
Finally, we collected testimonials from both CLEO volunteers and Brookdale residents and staff to show the personal impact the 
project had on members of both groups.

We recruited most of our members at a school club 
fair and held our first in-school meeting in March 2022. 
Afterward, we held meetings once per month to discuss 
the direction of the club and any trends or issues we had 
noticed. 
To get a better understanding of the needs of the 
residents at Brookdale, we sent out an initial survey to get 
a baseline for common problems. 
As we began hosting tech support sessions, we recognized 
members performing well. To gauge interest and plan 
accordingly, we provided a sign-up sheet for residents to help 
us plan the needed number of volunteers and to indicate the 
time and place of our meetings to residents in the Brookdale 
newsletter. Aaron kept in close contact with the Brookdale 
staff to inform them of any cancellations and to coordinate 
the weekly schedule based on the number of sign-ups.
 
After summer, we felt that a good structure for the tech 
support sessions had been achieved, so we also started 
brainstorming and planning the monthly lessons under 
the leadership of Derrick. We held four in total: how to 
use iPads, avoid online scams, the basics of the internet, 
and how to use Zoom.
Finally, we conducted an end survey on all participating 
members to assess the key metrics and to obtain testimonials.

After we decided to start CLEO, we began considering 
options for a retirement home to host our project. We 
researched several locations and determined which one 
would be the best fit based on factors such as distance, 
residents’ needs, and availability. We ultimately chose 
Brookdale, a retirement home that was conveniently 
located near our school, making it easier for our members 
to travel to and from the location regularly.
Aaron had been on a phone call with his grandma in 
February. While trying to help her accomplish some 
basic technological tasks, he started thinking about 
ways that he could help seniors like her improve their 
technological literacy. He later suggested the idea to the 
group. We realized that we shared similar experiences 
helping our grandparents with technology, and that is 
when the CLEO initiative was born.

During the planning stages of our project, we worked 
closely with the activity director at Brookdale to ensure that 
everything ran smoothly. After sending out surveys to the 
residents to learn more about their needs and analyzing the 
results, we shared our project expectations with our club 
members. We also held a meet-and-greet with the residents 
to get to know them and began holding weekly tech 
support meetings. As we progressed into the first month, we 
discussed our progress with our club members and made 
recommendations based on member performance and 
common issues we encountered. We also began considering 
potential topics for our future monthly classes.
Until early May, we manually set each session’s date by 
exchanging emails with the activities director at Brookdale. 
By early May, we decided instead to go at a set time every 
week. This change made our senior attendance increase 
significantly.

During the summer break, we continued to maintain our 
regular operations at the retirement home. While some 
members may have been on vacation, we still asked those 
who were available to come in and assist with tech support 
sessions. We recognized the importance of consistency and 
continuity in our project, and we wanted to ensure that the 
seniors we were helping had access to the support they 
needed throughout the break. We made sure to keep in 
touch with the staff at the retirement home and to discuss 
any potential changes or updates to our schedule. Despite 
the challenges that the summer months brought, we were 
committed to maintaining the same level of service and 
support for the seniors in our project.

Brookdale had acquired a dozen iPads for residents, but 
few knew how to utilize them. At the suggestion of the 
retirement home, we decided to conduct our first class 
on iPad basics. Three days later, Hurricane Ian hit Florida, 
one of the worst storms to hit the state in history. The 
Brookdale activities director reported to us that when 
they evacuated to Orlando, the residents were able to 
pass the time by playing games on the iPads that they 
had learned to use, thanks to our class.
In October, our monthly class covered internet 
scams and how to avoid them. During this class, we 
taught the residents how to spot the signs of typical 
fraudulent schemes such as fake banking calls, fake 
charities, and fake IRS calls. We also discussed the 
importance of being vigilant and cautious in regard 
to online and phone interactions.
In November, we held our monthly class on the 
internet. This class covered topics such as the basics 
of the web, how it works, and how to effectively 
search for information online. We emphasized the 
importance of online safety and provided tips on 
protecting personal information while browsing.
In December, our monthly class discussed the 
Zoom video conferencing platform, teaching the 
residents how to use the application. Zoom is 
used widely across a range of operating systems 
and device types, making it a good choice for all 
residents to stay connected with loved ones living 
far away. Even though the peak of COVID-19 
pandemic had passed by the time we started 
the project, this class still proved helpful for the 
residents in staying connected with loved ones. 
As the end of the project approached, we also 
began planning for its conclusion.
In January, we wrapped up the CLEO Initiative. We 
collected personal statements and final key metrics 
from the residents to determine whether they felt 
the project benefited them. While it was sad to say 
goodbye, we hope we can continue CLEO in the future. 
We are grateful that we had the opportunity to work 
with the seniors and positively impact their lives 
through technology education.

PROJECT QUALITY
To ensure our schedule ran smoothly, Aaron was responsible for keeping the retirement home informed of any schedule changes, 
including any upcoming breaks or holidays. Additionally, he worked to anticipate potential issues and took steps to address them 
proactively. Derrick brainstormed ideas for post-summer lessons well in advance, so we could more efficiently plan and prepare for 
the classes. By continuously monitoring and adapting our schedule, we were able to provide consistent, reliable support for the 
seniors at the retirement home.
We did not have any allocated funds for our project. Therefore, we relied on the available resources and devices. We made sure to 
utilize these resources effectively and efficiently.
To maintain project quality, we monitored the effectiveness of our tech support sessions through a few different methods. Derrick 
regularly checked in with the residents to ensure they were satisfied with the help they were receiving, and Christian kept track of 
attendance and the number of tech issues resolved. That allowed us to gauge the project’s success and to identify any areas for 
improvement. Additionally, Christian ensured that we had enough club members present to assist the residents adequately and 
kept note of any disparities for future planning. By paying close attention to these details, we could maintain the quality of our 
support sessions and ensure that the residents were receiving the best possible assistance.

After 36 weeks of service for 1.5 hours per week and 6 CLEO members in attendance on average, we served about 370 hours at 
Brookdale when the four monthly classes are taken into account. The total number of seniors we served was 93, and the total 
number of them that returned at least one additional time was 71. The number of project participants is the number of members 
in the CLEO club roster. Finally, the percent of issues resolved successfully is equal to the number of resident sessions (shown below 
and equal to 465) minus the number of problems we were unable to resolve (4), all divided by the number of resident sessions.

The number of resident sessions is the sum of the number of seniors who attended lessons and classes for each day. This can also 
be thought of as the total number of volunteer-resident interactions. The length of the average session is the total hours (370) 
divided by the total sessions (465) (multiplied by 60 to get minutes). Percent senior satisfaction is the mean of all scores received 
from the final survey to the question “how satisfied are you with the CLEO service” given on a scale from 1-10 and expressed here 
as a percentage. Percent senior attendance is the number of seniors who attended (93) divided by the number of seniors living at

BROOKDALE TESTIMONIALS
“ I have worked here for twenty-two years, 
and the help that you all gave is amazing. 
CLEO filled in a need that was lacking here. 
We needed someone that had knowledge 
about electronic gadgets, and you filled in 
that need. People need instructions, and 
often their families do not have the time to 
do what you are doing. I just want to thank 
you so much.
Erik Snyder
Brookdale Residence Manager
“ Very often, I brought CLEO up while talking 
to potential residents. I tell them how 
carefully you show them the real problem 
and how to fix it. That is something that 
their grandkids usually don’t take the time

Brookdale Director of Sales
“ I’ve enjoyed working with the CLEO team 
from Canterbury because I am not very 
good with my computer or my phone. They 
are great, super great to work with, and 
have lots of patience and care. There are a 
lot of things that CLEO has helped with, and 
I have much more waiting. What they are 
doing is fantastic.
Peter Green
Brookdale Resident
“ I am thrilled with what CLEO is doing, and 
I think they are wonderful. I have had three 
problems fixed by CLEO. Everything that 
they have done still works, and I understand 
what they did. I am very happy; I hope they 
come back in the future!

Brookdale Resident
“ I really appreciate the Canterbury guys that 
have come and helped me because I’m really 
not very tech-savvy. They’ve helped me with 
my computer and phone and different things, 
and I really appreciate them.
Nancy Davis
Brookdale Resident
“ The people from CLEO have a passion 
and love for seniors. Their patience and 
kindness 
were 
overwhelming. 
I 
would 
say that the knowledge of technology, 
things that younger people think about 
every day and older seniors don’t use, is 
extremely helpful. Taking your knowledge 
and spreading it throughout an older 
community is very helpful. CLEO has the 
time and the ability to do it right, and that is 
very important.

CLEO MEMBER TESTIMONIALS
“ CLEO has been an impactful organization 
that truly bridges gaps for those who aren’t 
technologically adept. It has been fulfilling 
being able to make lifelong connections 
with such amazing people. To be frank, I 
believe CLEO has the potential to integrate 
with high schools all around the nation. I am 
humbled to be a small part of their impact. 
Jake Zelewski
Canterbury Senior
“ Being a member of CLEO has heavily 
impacted me primarily because of how 
much I have been able to help educate the 
elderly on technology to ensure the issues 
they may have are solved. Taking time out 
of my day to fix problems with their phones 
or 
computers 
and 
teach 
them 
about 
their devices expands their capabilities 
and knowledge on technology, and that 
is very needed for many elderly people 
whose exposure of technology is limited. 
Even if their issue is small, they are always 
grateful after receiving assistance, and that 
satisfaction is what made me look forward 
to CLEO every week.
Krish Verma
Canterbury Junior
“ The ability to help provide much-needed 
assistance to the elderly population at 
Brookdale was truly remarkable and is 
something I’m very thankful to have been 
a part of. CLEO has not only helped those 
in need of it most, but it has also allowed 
for a special bond to form between two 
vastly different age groups with entirely 
different life experiences. A huge amount 
of fulfillment comes from being able to 
make such a positive impact on the lives 
of others; your presence is the “highlight” 
of their week. Looking forward, I would 
be eager to continue working on this 
project if more opportunities arose from 
the Computer Literacy Education Outreach 
Club.

have truly enjoyed helping my community 
this way! My biggest take away from CLEO 
is that small changes can have a big impact! 
Special thanks to Aaron, Christian, and Derrick

“ CLEO has been an amazing experience 
for me. Not only have I been able to 
make a difference in the lives of seniors at 
Brookdale Retirement home, but I have also 
developed strong connections with these 
amazing individuals. It has been so fulfilling 
to be able to provide much-needed tech 
support and assistance, and to see the joy 
and gratitude on the faces of the residents. I 
am grateful to be a part of this organization 
and to be able to make such a positive 
impact on the lives of others. I feel lucky to 
have joined this project, and I am hopeful 
that I will be able to continue to help and 
support others through CLEO in the future.

B. LESSONS LEARNED
INITIATING
PLANNING AND ORGANIZING
EXECUTION
While starting the initiative, we learned the importance of direct and persistent communication with key stakeholders. For 
example, we made a point to consistently email the activities director at the retirement home to ensure that we were on the 
same page and that our project was running smoothly. This emphasized the importance of actively moving your project’s 
direction and ensuring that everyone involved is informed and aligned. We also learned the value of being proactive and 
not waiting for issues to arise before addressing them. By being proactive and keeping open communication lines, we could 
effectively plan and execute our project.
While planning the project, we learned the importance of clear goal-setting and delegation of responsibilities. Establishing 
a realistic and achievable schedule was also crucial in ensuring the project’s success. Additionally, we learned that it is 
essential to include contingencies; it was always better to bring more volunteers than we thought we needed. It allowed 
us to accommodate additional residents who may have shown up at the last minute. We also learned the importance of 
keeping our members accountable for their attendance and ensuring that we have enough volunteers to support all of the 
residents adequately. Effective planning and organization were crucial to the success of our project and are certainly a core 
part of any other.
During the execution phase of the CLEO Initiative, we learned the importance of being flexible and adaptable in the face of 
challenges or changes in the project. We also learned that making everything as straightforward as possible is the most efficient 
when communicating complex concepts to seniors. We found that explaining something too in-depth can make the residents 
forget the essential parts of the explanation. Additionally, we learned that creating personal connections with the residents is 
always beneficial, as it makes the overall experience much more positive when they see us as friends rather than just tech support 
volunteers.
MONITORING AND CONTROLLING
As we began to monitor the project, we learned the importance of tracking progress, gathering feedback, and identifying and 
addressing any issues that had arisen to ensure our project’s success. One key lesson we learned was the importance of planning. 
For example, when we missed a week due to a school break and forgot to inform the retirement home, it confused the residents. 
This taught us to always be proactive in our communication and to anticipate potential roadblocks to minimize disruptions. We 
also learned the importance of being flexible and adaptable whenever a problem arose and working together as a team to find a 
solution. Overall, these lessons helped us better monitor and control our project’s direction and ensure that it was running smoothly 
and effectively.

This project was tremendously impactful on all involved. For this reason, we have resolved to do the following:
1. 
Resume operations at Brookdale
2. 
Expand the initiative to other locations.
Currently, we are slowly planning this “second phase” of the project. Although restarting operations may take a long time, we are 
confident the wait will be worth it. 
Our rationale for expanding the project is that 93 seniors aren’t enough. Although our work has helped the Brookdale 
residents navigate the digital world, they are just a tiny fraction of all the Seniors struggling with technology. We have 
already begun reaching out and working with our peers across 
the country in planning this expansion. 
These areas include:
• 
Cape Coral, Florida
• 
Naples, Florida
• 
Fort Myers, Florida
• 
Boston, Massachusetts
• 
Davidson, North Carolina
• 
Louisville, Kentucky
• 
Cincinnati, Ohio
• 
San Francisco, California
