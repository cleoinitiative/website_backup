Technological Illiteracy will be a recurring issue for generations to come; tech is advancing rapidly especially with the recent introduction of AI into society

Through our project, we aimed to give seniors the knowledge and confidence they needed to use their devices, access services online, and reduce their risk of falling victim to scams and other online dangers. We hope that by enabling seniors to improve their technological literacy, we have helped them live more fulfilling and independent lives and have mitigated their sense of anxiety around technology.

In addition to the expected benefits for the seniors, our project also provided numerous benefits for the students involved.

By participating in our project, students had the opportunity to develop a range of skills and experiences that will benefit

them personally and professionally. They also had the chance to make a meaningful difference in the lives of seniors in their community.
