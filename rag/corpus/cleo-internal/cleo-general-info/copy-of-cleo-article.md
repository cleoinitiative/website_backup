How fortunate we are at Bailey’s Glen to have this group assist us in the complicated field of Technology. There is a definite benefit to be located in the backyard of Hough High School and have these talented students patiently and enthusiastically provide support for our devices.

# How It Started

The CLEO Initiative came into existence in 2021 when students from Canterbury School of Fort Myers, namely Derrick Hueniken, Christian Laquis, and Aaron Smolyar, were discussing their grandparents' daily struggles with technology. They realized that even if they couldn't assist their grandparents from afar, they could make a difference by helping seniors in their own community. This movement quickly gained momentum, spreading to schools across the country, from Florida to Massachusetts.

# Getting to Cornelius

Earlier this year, one of the founders of Hough CLEO, Jack Dutton, was conversing with his friend from Florida when Aaron mentioned the club he had initiated. Aaron had been working on expanding the club to other parts of the country and suggested that Jack consider starting a branch at his school. Planning and initial email exchanges began in the winter, culminating in the first introductory meeting/forum held in May. The team, consisting of six members—Giancarlos, Jack, Oliver, Lily, Savannah, and Sydney—presented our goals and values in front of nearly 60 seniors. Today, CLEO is an incorporated club at Hough High School and has commenced hosting weekly tech forums and lessons.

# Where We’re Headed

CLEO is an active club with a presence in nearly a dozen schools across the country, spanning from Florida and North Carolina to Kentucky and Massachusetts. New branches are opening up every month, and we are continually eager to create more!
