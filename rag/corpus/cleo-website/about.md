# About CLEO Initiative

## Our Mission

CLEO's mission is to establish a community around providing access to technology and improving the quality of life for seniors who lack digital literacy skills.

## What is CLEO?

CLEO (Computer Literacy Education Outreach) is a student-led initiative that connects high school students with seniors to help bridge the digital divide through technology education.

## How It Works

1. **Student volunteers** from local high schools form CLEO chapters
2. **Chapters partner** with assisted living facilities, senior centers, and community organizations
3. **Regular sessions** are held where students help seniors one-on-one with technology
4. **Topics covered** include smartphones, video calling, email, social media, and internet safety

## Our Impact

CLEO chapters across the United States have helped thousands of seniors gain confidence with technology, enabling them to:

- Stay connected with family through video calls
- Access telehealth services
- Manage daily tasks online
- Feel more independent and less isolated
