## Empowering Seniors Through Technology

Technology is rapidly changing and it can be overwhelming for seniors who are not familiar with it. Our mission is to establish a community around providing access to technology and improving the quality of life for seniors who lack digital literacy skills.

The CLEO Initiative has chapters all over the United States. Join us today and make your impact on the seniors in your community.

### What We Do

CLEO (Computer Literacy Education Outreach) connects high school student volunteers with seniors at assisted living facilities and community centers. Our student volunteers help seniors learn:

- How to use smartphones and tablets
- Video calling with family (FaceTime, Zoom)
- Email and text messaging
- Social media basics
- Internet safety and avoiding scams
- Basic computer skills
