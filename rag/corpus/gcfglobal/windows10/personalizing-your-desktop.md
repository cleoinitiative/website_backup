## Personalizing your desktop

Windows 10 makes it easy to customize the look and feel of your desktop. To access the Personalization settings, right-click anywhere on the desktop, then select Personalize from the drop-down menu. The Personalization settings will appear.

Click the buttons in the interactive below to learn more about using the Personalization settings.

From here, you can choose and customize your desktop background.

The accent color affects things like the taskbar and the Start menu. By default, Windows 10 will assign an accent color based on your desktop background image. However, you can turn this feature off if you'd prefer to choose your own accent color.

From here, you can customize the appearance of your lock screen. As with your desktop background, you can use a built-in picture or select Browse to choose one of your own.

If you previously installed themes on an earlier version of Windows, you can view and select them here. However, Microsoft does not currently plan to release new themes for Windows 10.

From here, you can install new fonts.

From here, you can customize certain options for the Start menu, like choosing to show the Start menu in full-screen mode.

From here, you can customize the taskbar to lock it in its location or hide it in different modes.

Select Browse to choose a desktop background from one of your personal photos.

## To change the font size:

If you have difficulty seeing the text on your computer, you can increase the font size. Increasing the font size will also increase the size of icons and other items on your desktop.

- Open the Settings app, then select System.

- The Display options will appear. Use the drop-down arrow to scale up or down the size. Note that a larger size may interfere with the way some items appear on the screen.

- Once you've made your selection, the changes will take effect.

## To adjust ClearType settings:

ClearType allows you to fine tune how the text on your computer looks, which helps improve readability.

- From the settings pane, click the Find a setting search box.

- Choose Adjust ClearType text.

- The ClearType dialog box will appear. Follow the instructions, choosing the text that appears best to you.

- When you're done, click Finish. The ClearType settings will be applied.
