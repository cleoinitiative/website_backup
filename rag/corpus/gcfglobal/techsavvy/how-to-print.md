## How to print

Let’s cover the basic steps for how to print, along with a few helpful pointers.

- Make sure your printer is set up and that it’s turned on. If you need help setting up your printer, check out our lesson in the tutorial Basic Computer Skills.

- Find and open the file that you would like to print.

- Regardless of which program you’re using, Print is always located under File in the upper toolbar. Usually it’s toward the bottom of the drop-down menu.

- In the pop-up window, simply click the Print button once. This will print one copy.

## Some extra tips

- Be sure to double-check the length of your document. If you only need to print a few pages, you can adjust the page range in the pop-up.

- If you notice the printer you’re using isn’t listed, that means it isn’t set up yet, or it isn’t connected to your WiFi network.

- If it’s offline and you keep trying to print, you’ll see the print jobs start backing up into what’s called a queue. You might need to clear the queue and then restart your printer. That way you don’t end up with a bunch of copies you don’t need.
