## YouTube for mobile devices

More and more people are watching videos on the go these days. In fact, more than 40 percent of YouTube's traffic comes from mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets. And because the free YouTube app for Android and iOS devices is designed to be very similar to the desktop version of the site, you'll find it especially easy to use if you're already familiar with the YouTube interface.

## YouTube for TVs

If you have Wi-Fi or an Internet-streaming device connected your TV—such as a Roku, Chromecast, or modern gaming console—you may be able to watch YouTube videos directly on your TV with the YouTube app. You can visit this page from Google to see if your device is supported. If you have the YouTube app on your TV, you can pair your computer or mobile device to make watching videos even easier. Watch this video from the YouTube Help channel to learn how to pair your computer and mobile device to your TV.
