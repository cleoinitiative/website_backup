## Creating and sharing playlists

Playlists are a great way to organize and share the stuff you find on YouTube. You can think of playlists as a mixtape, but for videos instead of music! For example, you might want to collect some of your favorite science videos to watch again later. Once you've created a playlist, it's easy to share it with your friends.

## To create a playlist:

- Locate and select the Save to button below the video player. A menu will appear. From here, you can choose to add the video to an existing playlist or create a new one. In our example, we'll choose Create new playlist.

- Type the playlist name, choose the desired privacy level for the playlist, and choose Create.

- The playlist will be created. You can now add videos to the playlist at any time. To view or manage the playlist, you can select it from the Guide.
