## Sharing options

Sharing is probably one of our favorite things to do on YouTube. After all, who doesn't want to see that funny video of a dog on a skateboard?

To share a video, simply click the Share button below the video player.

This will bring up a menu with a variety of sharing options. Some of the simplest options allow you to share the video with social networks like Facebook and Twitter, or to copy and paste a link to a video.

Other sharing options allow you embed the video in a website or quickly email the video to a friend.
