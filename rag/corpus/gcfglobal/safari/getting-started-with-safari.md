## Lesson 1: Getting Started with Safari

## Introduction

Safari is a free web browser from Apple. It comes pre-installed with all Apple computers, making it a popular browser for many users. It also uses significantly less power and memory than other browsers, which means it won't drain your battery as quickly if you're using it on a laptop.

In this lesson, we'll talk about how to access and use Safari.

Safari is not available for Windows. To learn about different Windows browsers, read our Choosing a Web Browser lesson.

## Accessing Safari

- Safari should be located on your Mac's dock by default.  Whenever you want to open Safari, simply click the icon on the dock.

- If the Safari icon is not on your dock, you can also open it from  Launchpad.

If you want to use Safari as your main web browser, you can set it as your default browser. Review our lesson on Customizing Safari to learn how.

## Getting to know Safari

Safari offers many of the same features as most web browsers. While it is fairly simple to use, you'll need to spend some time becoming familiar with some of its features.
