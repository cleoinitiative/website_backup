## Lesson 1: Typing

If you use a keyboard every day, you might not remember how difficult learning to type can be. Our learners ask for typing help more than anything else—and we haven’t found many free resources worth recommending. So we decided to create our own. Because the process of learning to type can be discouraging, we explored a coaching model that includes supportive feedback—and because everyone learns differently, we built in the option to tone it down or turn it off. We built the entire project in HTML5, which made this tutorial a learning experience for us too.
