Users on Pinterest are commonly called pinners. Whenever you find pinners you like, you can choose to follow their pins. This way, whenever they share new pins, you'll see them on your homepage.

Followers are other Pinterest users who have chosen to follow your pins. Whenever you add a new pin, it will appear on your followers' homepages.

A board is where you'll save related pins. For example, you could create a board for the different recipes you find online.

When you save a pin you discover on Pinterest to one of your own boards, it was called re-pinning. Now it's called saving.

A pin is a visual bookmark that links from Pinterest to another website.

A source link is the URL of the website where a pin comes from.
