## Lesson 1: What is Pinterest?

## What is Pinterest?

Pinterest is a popular social network. While other social networks like Facebook and Twitter focus on personal sharing and status updates, Pinterest is all about collecting and sharing the things you find online.

## Why use Pinterest?

We use the Internet to search for all kinds of information, but it can be difficult to keep everything we find organized. Think of Pinterest as a sort of digital bulletin board or scrapbook for collecting the things you find online.

For example, let's say you like using the Internet to discover new recipes. Whenever you find a recipe you like, you could save that recipe to a board. When you click a pin, it will link you back to the original website, turning your board into a collection of visual bookmarks. You can see an example of a real board below.

Pinterest isn't just about creating your own boards. It also allows you to follow the pins created by your friends and other users, or pinners as they're called on Pinterest. Whenever you're browsing Pinterest, you can easily save pins you discover to your own boards.
