## iPhone 6S: Frequently asked questions

On September 9, 2015, Apple introduced two new versions of the iPhone: the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus. We'd like to offer you a brief overview of the new iPhones and try to answer some questions you may have at this time.

The iPhone 6S is no longer the most recent version, so parts of this lesson may be out of date. To learn about the newest version, see iPhone X, 8, and 8 Plus: Frequently Asked Questions.

## iPhone 6S and 6S Plus: What's new?

The biggest difference between these two new iPhones and older models is the new 3D Touch feature, which allows for more types of multi-touch interaction. Both versions of the iPhone 6S also include a higher-quality camera than previous models.

## When is it available?

The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus became available for pre-order September 12, 2015.

## Do I need a case?

Although you can use it without one, it's a good idea to purchase some type of case. All iPhones use glass screens that can break if dropped.
