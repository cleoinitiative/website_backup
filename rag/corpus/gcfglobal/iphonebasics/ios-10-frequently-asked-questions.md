## How do I get iOS 10?

If you buy a new iOS device, iOS 10 will come pre-installed. You won't need to do anything to install it.

If you already have a compatible iOS device, you can download and install iOS 10 by going to your Settings, selecting General, and tapping Software Update.

## Am I required to upgrade?

While it's not required, we recommend upgrading your device to iOS 10 if possible. This will help keep your phone up to date and working with newer apps.

## If I don't upgrade, will I still be able to download newer apps?

Yes, but some apps may not always work correctly. If you don't upgrade to iOS 10, you may want to research how well an app will work on your device before downloading or updating it.

Even if an app has always worked perfectly on your device, there is a chance that the newer versions may only run smoothly on iOS 10. You may want to avoid updating your favorite apps unless you are sure they will work with your device's operating system. Once you update an app, you won't be able to go back to an older version.

## Will my apps still be there after I upgrade?

Yes. Any app you previously had installed on your phone will still be there once you upgrade to iOS 10. Some built-in Apple apps, like Messages and Calendar, will be updated automatically when you upgrade.

## Will my apps still work after I upgrade?

Almost all apps installed on iOS 9 should work correctly in iOS 10. If not, the app developer will likely release an update to address the issue.
