## iPhone 7: Frequently asked questions

On September 7, 2016, Apple introduced two new versions of the iPhone: the iPhone 7 and the larger iPhone 7 Plus. We'd like to offer you a brief overview of the new iPhones and try to answer some questions you may have at this time.

The iPhone 7 is no longer the most recent version, so parts of this lesson may be out of date. To learn about the newest version, see iPhone X, 8, and 8 Plus: Frequently Asked Questions.

## iPhone 7 and 7 Plus: What's new?

While the new iPhones may look fairly similar to the older ones, there are several changes that have been made:

- The iPhone 7 Plus  has two rear cameras: a telephoto lens and a wide-angle lens. This will allow you to take higher-quality pictures and zoom in farther without sacrificing quality. It will also allow you to use a bokeh feature, which blurs the background while keeping the foreground in focus.

- There is no longer a headphone jack. We'll talk more about this change below.

- There are now two speakers, one at the top and one at the bottom, for stereo sound.

- Both versions are water- and dust-resistant.

- Both versions have improved battery life, a brighter screen, a more powerful processor, and various other improvements over previous versions.

## How do I use my earbuds without a headphone jack?

With this newest iPhone release, Apple has removed the headphone jack that has been part of all previous iPhones. From now on, all headphones will need to connect via Lightning or Bluetooth. Each phone will come with a pair of earbuds that plugs in to the Lightning port, as well as an adapter that will allow you to still use your current headphones with the Lightning port. Apple also released AirPods in October 2016, which can connect wirelessly to the iPhone.

## When is it available?

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were released September 16, 2016.

## Do I need a case?

Although you can use it without one, it's a good idea to purchase some type of case because all iPhones use glass screens that can break if dropped.
