## Browsing with Safari

Safari is a web browser that comes built in to the iPhone. You'll use it to access websites on your device. Safari's interface is similar to those you might find on a desktop web browser, and it also has a few unique features to make mobile browsing easier.

## Getting to know Safari

Click the buttons in the interactive below to learn more about the Safari interface.

The Reader feature allows you to view web articles in a large easy-to-read format, free of any ads or clutter.

The address bar displays the URL for the current page. To navigate to a new page, just enter a new address. You can also use the bar to search online.

Use the back and forward buttons to navigate between pages you've recently visited. You can also swipe left and right to access recent pages.

Use the Share button to create a bookmark, save the page to your reading list, and more. You can even email the link to your friends or share it on Twitter and Facebook.

Tap here to see your bookmarks and reading list. You can still read websites that you've added to your reading list when your iPhone is offline.

Tap here to create a new tab or switch between your current tabs.

## Browsing online

Safari includes several features that make online browsing easy. We've included some of the most helpful features below.

## The Favorites page

When you create a new tab, the Favorites page will appear, which includes shortcuts to your most frequently visited websites. You can tap a website to navigate to that page or enter a URL into the address bar.

## Opening a link in a new tab

If you find a link to a website, you can open that link in a new tab. This allows you to open the site without losing your place on the original page.

- To open a link in a new tab, tap and hold the link, then select Open in New Tab.

## Multi-touch zoom

Sometimes the text of webpages may appear too small. Luckily, there are two ways to zoom in and out using multi-touch gestures:

- Double-tap the screen: This gesture will automatically zoom the content to fit the screen. Double-tap again to zoom out.

- Pinch the screen: This gesture allows you to zoom in and out manually.

## Screen orientation

Remember, you can always rotate the iPhone to change the screen orientation. Some websites may work well in portrait mode, while others will look best in landscape mode.

## Adding websites to your Home screen

If you find that you frequently visit the same website, you might want to add the site as a bookmark. If you want even faster access, you can add an icon to a website on your Home screen. Just tap the Share button, scroll over and select Add to Home Screen, then click Add.

The page will appear as an icon on your Home screen. When you tap the icon, Safari will open and the website will appear.
