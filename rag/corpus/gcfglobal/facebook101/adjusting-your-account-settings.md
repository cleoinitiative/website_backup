## Account settings

Once you start using Facebook, you may need to modify your account settings. These settings control things like your password and notifications. Changing these settings is optional, and you can modify them at any time.

To modify your Account settings, click the drop-down arrow on the toolbar, then select Settings.

If you're using the mobile app, tap the Menu button and select Settings & Privacy.

Click the buttons in the interactive below to learn more about modifying your account settings.

Here, you'll be able to modify some of your basic account information, like your name and contact information.

Security settings can help to make your Facebook account more secure. You have the option to enable two-step verification, which can help prevent someone else from accessing your Facebook account. You can also change your password here.

Here, you can control your privacy settings. For example, you can control who can see the things you share and who can send you friend requests.

By default, Facebook emails you important notifications, like when you receive a friend request. If you'd prefer not to receive emails about your Facebook activity, you can turn off some or all notifications.

You can use your mobile phone to send and receive Facebook updates and messages via text message. If you've never used Facebook texts, you can get started by clicking Add a Phone.

If you're concerned about the amount of information Facebook stores about your identity, you can download a copy of your Facebook information.
