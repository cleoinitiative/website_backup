## Introduction

If you're thinking about joining Facebook, this lesson will show you everything you need to get started. We'll explain some common Facebook terms and how to create a Facebook account. We'll also explore the Facebook homepage, Timeline, and Facebook for mobile devices.

Watch the video below to learn more about getting started with Facebook.

## Common Facebook terms

Friends? Likes? Status updates? If you're new to Facebook, there are a lot of terms and phrases that may seem a little confusing at first. Reviewing some of the most commonly used terms will give you a better understanding of how Facebook works and what to expect as you get started.

Click the buttons in the interactive below to learn about some common terms on Facebook.

You can add people you know as friends on Facebook. Your friends will see the things you share, including status updates and photos.

You'll receive a notification in an email message and on your homepage whenever someone interacts with you on Facebook.

One of the most common things people share on Facebook are status updates, which are short, text-based posts your friends can see and comment on.

Whenever your friends share something on Facebook, you can choose to like the post. This is just a simple way of showing your friends that you enjoyed what they shared.

Friends can tag you in photos and posts they share on Facebook. Posts you're tagged in will appear on your Timeline.

Whenever your friends share on Facebook, you can leave a comment about their posts.

The News Feed is a stream of updates from your friends and any Facebook Pages you follow. This is where you'll probably spend most of your time on Facebook because it's where you can view and comment on what's happening with your friends.

Also known as your profile page, the Timeline is where you'll share information about yourself on Facebook. For example, it's where you'll post your profile picture and share basic information about yourself.

## Creating a Facebook account

Before you can use Facebook, you must create an account. Creating a Facebook account is free. All you need to get started is an email address and a few minutes of your time.

## To create a Facebook account:

- Navigate to www.facebook.com in your web browser.

- Under the words Sign Up, enter your personal information and desired password, then click Sign Up.

- You can then follow the directions on the screen to find friends, upload a profile picture, learn about privacy settings, and more.

Before you can access all of Facebook's features, you'll need to confirm your email address. To do this, sign in to your email account, open the confirmation message from Facebook, and click Confirm Your Account.

## Exploring Facebook

Once you create an account, you'll want to spend a little time becoming familiar with the different parts of Facebook, including the homepage and Timeline.

## The homepage

The homepage appears whenever you sign in to Facebook. The homepage displays your News Feed, which shows the things your friends have shared on Facebook. The homepage also allows you to navigate to other parts of Facebook, such as your Timeline.

Click the buttons in the interactive below to become more familiar with the homepage.

You can click your name to view and edit your Timeline.

You can use the search bar to search for friends, Facebook Pages, and more.

You'll use the Make Post field to share things on Facebook. It's easy to share a status update, photos, links, and more. The information you share will be posted on your News Feed and Timeline, as well as on your friends' feeds.

Here, you can navigate to other parts of Facebook, including your upcoming events, photos, groups, and apps.

The News Feed is a stream of posts and updates from your friends and the Facebook Pages you follow.

You can chat with other friends who are currently signed in to Facebook.

You can click  here to search for friends who already use Facebook.

Here, you'll be notified about recent activity on Facebook, including friend requests, messages, and notifications.

## The Timeline

The Timeline (also called your profile page) is where you'll share information about yourself. Whenever you post an update, it appears on your Timeline. Your friends can also share posts on your Timeline.

Click the buttons in the interactive below to become more familiar with your Timeline.

Your profile picture represents you across Facebook. This is the picture your friends will see when you share and comment on Facebook.

From here, you can view and edit your profile information. This is  where you'll share details about your work history, relationships,  interests, and more.

From here, you can see photos you've shared and photos you've been tagged in by others.

Your cover photo is a large picture that is only  visible on your Timeline. A cover photo doesn't have to be a picture of  you. Instead, you might choose something that expresses your personality  or interests.

The Timeline includes your posts and activity, as well as things that your friends have posted on your Timeline.

It's easy to post a status update, photos, links, and more on the Timeline. The information you share will be posted here and on your friends' feeds.

Basic information you've shared about yourself will appear here. You can customize what you'd like to include.

## Facebook for mobile devices

Facebook makes it easy to connect on the go. In fact, most Facebook users primarily access the site from a mobile device. Facebook offers an official mobile app on a variety of smartphones and tablets, including iOS and Android.

You can use the mobile app to do just about everything you can do in the desktop version of Facebook: post status updates and pictures, read stories and updates, and chat with friends. We'd like to give you a quick overview of the two most popular versions of the Facebook app: Facebook for Android and Facebook for iPhone. While the interface for these apps is somewhat different, you'll notice that each app gives you access to the same basic features.

If you don't have a smartphone, you may be able to access a limited version of Facebook on your phone through the Facebook for Every Phone program or Facebook texts.
