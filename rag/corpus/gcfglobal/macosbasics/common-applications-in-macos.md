## Common applications in macOS

macOS comes with several useful applications already installed. You can accomplish most common tasks using just these apps without the need to install others.

Many of these apps can be opened by clicking their icon on the Dock at the bottom of the screen. If an app's icon is not present on the Dock, it can be found by clicking the Launchpad icon.
