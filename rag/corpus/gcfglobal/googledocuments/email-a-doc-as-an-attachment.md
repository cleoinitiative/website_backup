## Email a doc as an attachment

Google Docs has a feature that allows you to quickly and easily send a copy of your document to anyone with an email address.

Watch the video below to learn how to use the feature.

## To email a doc directly from Google Docs:

- Click File > Email as attachment.

- From here, you're essentially sending an email from the Gmail account that you are signed in as. You can enter a recipient's email address, create a subject line, and write a message.

- Click the drop-down menu in the bottom-left to choose the file type for your attachment.

- Optional: If you want the document to be included within the body of the email instead of as an attachment, select the Don't attach checkbox. This may help if the recipient can't open certain files.

- When your email is ready, click Send.

You don't need to share the document with anyone or change the permissions in order to use this feature. It only sends a static copy of your document to the recipient. This means that they will not have access to the Google Doc itself.

## Integrating with Gmail

It's worth noting that when you send your document with Google Docs, the email it generates will not appear in the sent messages of your Gmail, nor will Google Docs keep a record of the email.

However, if the recipient responds to your email, their response will appear in your Gmail, just like a regular email.
