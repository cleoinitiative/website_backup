## Introduction

Google Docs has a drawing tool that's designed for inserting text boxes and shapes into your document. Although they're not necessary for every document, text boxes and shapes can be used to set important details apart from the rest of your document or to organize information. For example, rectangles, lines, and arrows can be used together to create a flow chart.

In this lesson, you'll learn the drawing tool's commands and how to insert a drawing or text box into your document. You'll also learn how to format and change the order of text boxes and shapes.

Watch the video below to learn more about inserting text boxes and shapes in Google Docs.

## About the drawing tool

When you're ready to add a text box or shape to your document, you'll work with the drawing tool. It offers a variety of shapes, arrows, callouts, and line styles that are easily customized for your needs. For example, you can create a diagram using shapes and add text to each shape to highlight important information. The drawing tool opens as a dialog box in your document, and this is where you'll create, format, and edit text boxes and shapes using the drawing tool's commands.

Click the buttons in the interactive below to become familiar with the drawing tool's commands.

The Actions menu provides a variety of editing options for working with your document, like cut, copy, and paste. You can also edit the rotation and order of the shapes in your drawing. When you have finished your drawing, you can choose Download as to save it in a different image format.

When you are satisfied with your drawing and are ready to insert it into your document, click Save & Close.

If you've made a mistake or if you want to remove a previous action, you can Undo it. Choose Redo to make removed changes reappear.

The Line command offers a variety of line styles. Use a basic line to create an organizational map, an arrow to design a flowchart, or a polyline to create your own shape.

Google Docs provides a variety of shapes, arrows, callouts, and equation shapes. They can be resized, reordered, and customized with text. To create a shape, select a shape style. Then click, hold, and drag the mouse in the drawing area to create the desired size.

Text boxes allow you to easily move or set text apart in a document. In Google Docs, you can customize the lines of a text box, the size and color of the font, and the color of the background inside the text box. To create a text box, select the text box command. Then click, hold, and drag the mouse in the drawing area to create the desired size.

Select Fill color or Line color to display the color palette. Fill color changes the background color of the shape or text box, while line color modifies the color of the border line around the shape or text box.

Selecting the Line Width command allows you to narrow or widen the border line of your shape or text box.

If you have added text to a text box or shape, you can use the Formatting commands to edit the font size and color of the text. You also have the option of bolding, italicizing, and underlining text. These commands appear when a text box or shape is selected.

The Alignment command allows you to left align, center, right align, or justify the text inside the text box or shape. Additionally, you can choose to align the text to the top, middle, or bottom of the text box or shape.

Google Docs has a standalone version of the drawing application. This version has more features than the Documents Drawing app, including the ability to upload your own images as part of the drawing. If you want more features, you can use the standalone version to create your drawing. Then you can download the drawing as an image to your Google Drive and insert it into your document.

## Adding shapes

You can add a variety of shapes to your document, including arrows, callouts, squares, stars, and flowchart shapes. Shapes are customizable, so you can add text and change the background color and line width. You may find shapes useful for creating diagrams and flow charts, and they can add visual appeal to your document as well.

To delete a shape from your document, select it and press the Backspace or Delete key on your keyboard.

To reopen the drawing tool to edit the shape, select the desired shape and click Edit from the options that appear below the drawing.

## Adding text boxes

You may want to insert a text box into your document to draw attention to specific text or to have the ability to easily move text around within your document. Text boxes are similar to shapes. You can apply many of the same formatting options, like changing the background color and line style.

## Customizing text boxes and shapes

The drawing tool has a variety of line and shape tools you can use to format your text box or shape. You can also modify the size and color of the font inside the text box or shape, as well as the colors of the background and lines.

## To format a text box or shape:

- With the drawing tool open, select the desired text box or shape.

- Click the desired formatting command to modify the text box or shape.

- The shape will appear formatted.

To add or edit the text inside of a text box or shape, double-click it to open the text editing box.

## To change the order of text boxes or shapes:

If one shape overlaps another, you may need to change the ordering so the correct shape appears in front. You can bring a shape to the front or send it to the back. If you have several overlapping objects, you may need to use the Bring forward or Send backward options to achieve the correct ordering.

- In the Drawing dialog box, right-click the desired text box or shape. Hover the mouse over Order, then select an ordering option.

- The order will appear changed in the drawing.
