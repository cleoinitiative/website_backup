## Installing add-ons

Learning how to install and use add-ons allows you to do even more with Google Docs. Like the name implies, add-ons literally add features on to Google Docs. There are add-ons that can help you create bibliographies, forms, equations, diagrams, and more.

Watch the video below to learn how to install add-ons.

## Add-on performance and security

Since add-ons are made by third party content creators, you should use caution when installing them. Google cannot guarantee that all add-ons are safe, secure, or reliable. It's a good idea to read some of the reviews to see whether other users have had a good experience with the add-on. You might also want to research the publisher and read the add-on's privacy policy before installing the add-on.

As part of the installation process, you have grant the add-on certain permissions, for example the ability to view and manage all of the files in your Google Drive. If you're not comfortable granting these permissions, you should not install the add-on. You should be especially careful if your Google Account contains sensitive information.

## To install an add-on:

- In the toolbar, go to Add-ons > Get add-ons.

- Optional: If you know what you're looking for, you can enter a keyword into the search bar at the top of the page.

- Click an add-on to learn more about it. It's best to use add-ons with high ratings.

- A window appears with more information about the add-on. If you decide you trust the add-on and want to use it, click Install.

- A series of popups will appear. Follow the onscreen instructions to install the add-on.

- Congratulations! The add-on is now installed. Another dialog box may appear that shows you how to use the add-on. When you're ready, click Next.

- Some add-ons ask you to create an account or subscribe to a paid plan. In our example, we are just going to click Done.

## To use an add-on:

This example uses the add-on Icons for Slides & Docs. If you are using a different add-on, a few features may look similar, but most will be very different.

- In the toolbar, go to the Add-ons menu and hover over the name of the add-on. A submenu will appear with one or more options. In this example, we'll click Start.

- The add-on opens in a new window or pane. In our example, we can use the pane to search for icons, customize them, and add them to the document. Depending on the add-on, you may have different options.

## To remove an add-on:

- In the toolbar, go to Add-ons > Manage add-ons.

- Click the add-on that you want to uninstall.

- Click Uninstall.

- Confirm your choice by clicking Uninstall App.

Add-ons can be extremely helpful, but remember to always do research and be careful when choosing which add-ons to install.
