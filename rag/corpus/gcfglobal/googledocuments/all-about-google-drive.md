## Lesson 1: All About Google Drive

## What is Google Drive?

Google Drive is a free service from Google that allows you to store files online and access them anywhere using the cloud. Google Drive also gives you access to free web-based applications for creating documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and more.

## Why use Google Drive?

Google Drive is one of the most popular cloud storage services available today. If you've never used a cloud-based storage service like Google Drive before, take a moment to consider the advantages of keeping your files online. Because files can be accessed from any computer with an Internet connection, Drive eliminates the need to email or save a file to a USB drive. And because Drive allows you to share files, working with others becomes much easier.

## Creating files on Google Drive

Google Drive doesn't just store your files; it also allows you to create, share, and manage documents with its own productivity apps. If you've ever used a suite like Microsoft Office, some things about Google Drive's apps might seem familiar. For instance, the types of files you can work with are similar to files that can be created with various Microsoft Office programs.

Below are the types of files you can create and share on Google Drive:

- Documents: For composing letters, flyers, essays, and other text-based files (similar to Microsoft Word documents)

- Spreadsheets: For storing and organizing information (similar to Microsoft Excel workbooks)

- Presentations: For creating slideshows (similar to Microsoft PowerPoint presentations)

- Forms: For collecting and organizing data

- Drawings: For creating simple vector graphics or diagrams

## Challenge!

Answer the following questions. You can write down your answers or just think about them.

- What type of files do you use on a daily basis? On a weekly basis?

- Where are you when you access these files? What devices do you access them with?

- Can you think of any files you'd like to sync across multiple devices?

- Of these files, could you use Google Drive to store them?

- Think of a few situations when you might need to collaborate on a file with others.
