## Uninstalling software from your Mac

If you find that you no longer use an application, you can uninstall the software to remove it from your computer. This is a good way to clear up space on your hard drive and keep your computer free of clutter.

- Open a new Finder window, then select Applications.

- Locate the desired application, then click and drag it to the Trash Can on the Dock.

- Empty the Trash Can.

## That's it! The application will be removed from your computer.

There are some applications that can't be removed this way. To completely uninstall an application like this, you'll need to locate and delete its Library files. This can be a little complicated, so we'd recommend following these instructions from MacRumors.
