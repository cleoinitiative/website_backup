## Lesson 1: Android: Frequently Asked Questions

## Android: Frequently asked questions

Android is an operating system for smartphones and tablets. Depending on the age and manufacturer of your device, you may or may not have the most recent version. Below are some tips to help you understand the differences.

## What is the most recent version of Android?

The most recent version of Android is 9.0 "Pie", which was released in August 2018. To learn more, visit Android History at the official Android website.

## How can I tell which version I have?

The steps for checking your version vary depending on your device (sometimes depending on your version, believe it or not!). Below are general instructions that should work for most Android devices.

- Open your device's settings.

- Look for an option that says About Device, About Phone, or something similar.

- Find your Android version on the list of specifications.

## How do I get the most recent version?

The most recent compatible version will be sent to your device automatically whenever there's an update or new release. All you have to do is accept, and your device will take care of the rest. If you have an older phone or tablet, you may not be able to upgrade to the latest version.

## What are the differences between versions?

Sometimes the differences are purely cosmetic; sometimes they can affect your device in more important ways. Below are just a few examples of things that might be different from version to version:

- Icons, screen layout, and other visual elements

- New apps or features

- Changes to existing features

- "Hidden" improvements that may boost your device's performance
