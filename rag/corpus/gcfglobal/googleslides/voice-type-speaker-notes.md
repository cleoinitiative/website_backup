## Voice type speaker notes

Preparing for a presentation without an adequate amount of time to do so is stressful. Voice type speaker notes is a feature of Google Slides presentations that can quickly record and type your thoughts underneath each slide.

If you are using a computer or a smartphone, adding speaker notes looks a little different. On a computer, the voice typing feature only works if you are using Chrome as your web browser. Later in this lesson, we’ll take a look at the mobile process.

Watch the video below to learn how to use the voice type speaker notes feature.

## Voice typing using a computer

For the voice typing feature to work, you will need to use Chrome as your web browser.

- To begin, select the slide from the Slides navigation pane to add speaker notes.

- Click Tools, then select Voice type speaker notes.

- Click the drop-down arrow above the microphone icon to change the language.

- Click the microphone icon to turn it on.

- If you haven’t already allowed Google to use your microphone, you may see a pop-up asking for access. Click Allow.

- When speaking into the microphone, keep in mind that you have to say the punctuation out loud. For example: "With the help of event planners comma people can celebrate various milestones in their lives period." What you say into the microphone will show up underneath the slide as speaker notes.

- When you are done speaking, click the microphone icon to turn it off.

- You may notice that the voice typing feature may not capture every word accurately. You can edit the text as you normally would or you can right-click the underlined words to see suggested changes.

## Voice typing using a smartphone

The process is a little different on a smartphone since voice type speaker notes is not available on mobile yet. There is an alternative: You can either type information or use your phone's built-in voice typing feature. In order to follow along, you will need to download the Google Slides app.

- Click the three dots in the upper-right corner.

- Tap the switch next to Speaker notes to display speaker notes.

- Select a slide from the slides navigation pane to add speaker notes.

- Then, tap the Speaker Notes text box below the slide.

- As mentioned previously, voice typing can only be done using your phone or tablet's built-in voice typing feature. On an iPhone, you can access this feature by tapping the microphone icon on the keyboard.

Correcting a lot of misspelled words or odd phrases after recording can be cumbersome on a tablet or mobile device. You may want to re-record if there are many mistakes.

Whether you use speaker notes to practice what you are going to say or as a reference, Google Slides voice type speaker notes feature can quickly capture your thoughts.
