## Downloading and printing files from Google Drive

Once you've created a file, it will be accessible whenever you sign in to Google Drive. However, there may be times when you want to download or print a file for offline access.

## To download a file:

- Locate and right-click the file you want to download, then select Download.

- The file will be downloaded to your computer.

## To choose a file format:

By default, Google Drive will choose the most common file format whenever you download a file. For example, if you download a Google Document, it will automatically be saved as a .docx file, which is used by Microsoft Word and most other word processors. However, there may be times when you want to choose a different format, such as PDF.

- Double-click the desired file to open it.

- The file will appear in a new tab. Select File > Download as, then choose the desired file type. In this example, we'll choose PDF Document (.pdf).

- The file will be downloaded to your computer in the desired file type.

## To print a file:

- Double-click the desired file to open it.

- Select File > Print.

- The Print dialog box will appear, along with a preview of your file on the right. Choose the desired options, then click Print.

Note that these options will vary depending on the type of file you're printing. For example, you'll have different options for printing a spreadsheet than you would for printing a presentation.

## Challenge!

- Open our example file. Make sure you're signed in to Google, then click File > Make a copy.

- Download the file as a PDF.

- If your device is connected to a printer, try printing the file.
