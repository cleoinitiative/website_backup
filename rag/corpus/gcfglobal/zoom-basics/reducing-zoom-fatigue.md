## Reducing "Zoom fatigue"

One drawback to video chatting is that people find themselves feeling drained or tired afterwards. What you’re experiencing is called "zoom fatigue." We've put together some tips that may help you improve how you feel after video calling.

## Quick tips to ease Zoom fatigue

- Think About Place: Limit distractions by finding a quiet place to make the call. Let people in your home know that you have a meeting at a certain time.

- Clear Away Clutter: Clean off your desk so that you only have what you need for the call in front of you. That way you don't have to search through everything. Close out of any unnecessary windows on your computer.

- Take a Break: Before the meeting starts, get up and walk away from your desk. This gives your body a chance to move and your brain a chance to reset.

- Limit Distractions: During the call, you can switch from grid view to speaker view. Also, you can blur or replace your background to help others focus more on what you’re saying instead of being distracted by what’s behind you.

- Consider Video Options: If you're allowed to, you might want to turn your camera off when you’re not talking. Some apps may allow you to hide your "self-view." That way people can still see you, but you can’t see yourself. If you use this feature, remember that the camera is still on, so don’t do anything embarrassing!

Following these tips may help you deal with zoom fatigue. Of course, another solution is to just do fewer video calls. A regular phone call or sending an email still works!
